Angular project for the Csharp academy.

#### How to start

#### Challenges and overal thoughts

Angular is very relaxing to work with. It does take a bit more use than React, but that's because React allows you to get away with a lot of things angular dosn't.
The Service and Rxjs aspect of Angular is also more intuitive than React's Redux libraries. It just feels better to work with state using Rxjs, this might be a bias since i did owrk with angular before.

I tried to make the table component generic enough to be reusable in other projects using the behavious subject and other observables.

I used tailwind in this project again, i'm starting to get more comfortable with it. I didn't do tests since there isn't a lot of things that would warrant tests.

Overall, pretty straightforward project.
